# Overview

* Adds a lamp that is colored based on the biome where it is built
* Adds a constant combinator that outputs the color of the biome where it is built
* Combinator color is provided as component Red, Green, and Blue signals
* Lamp color and combinator signal values are updated when the entity is built, and every time the GUI is opened
* Biome color is based on the map color of the dominant tile in a small radius around the entity

* [Subtle Lighting](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/dim_lamps) - Modifies the intensity of lamps, creating a more gradual falloff to the darkness beyond
